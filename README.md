US Airline Delay Analysis from 2016-2019

Airline Delay Analysis

Flight delays are the most common and most unpleasant experience people fear. Millions of passengers experience flight delays each year in the United States, resulting in lost flight connections and wasted valuable time for people. Many flights are delayed daily, resulting in various cost penalties for airlines and passengers. The airline's reputation is at stake, and passenger time is at stake. Delays are treated as one of the airline's most memorable performance indicators. There are many inevitable reasons. For example, Weather conditions, air traffic, or other unexpected events. However, there may be reasons why it can be fixed by improving the process. 

Flight delays have turned out to be an essential challenge and hassle for air transportation structures all around the world. The aviation enterprise is persevering with to be afflicted by financial losses related to flight delays all the time. According to facts from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) of the United States, greater than 20% of U.S. flights have been not on time in 2018. These flight delays have an excessive financial effect withinside the U.S. this is equal to 40.7 billion bucks according to the year. Passengers go through a lack of time, overlooked enterprise possibilities or amusement activities, and airways trying to make up for delays end in greater gas intake and a bigger detrimental environmental effect.

To lighten the negative monetary and natural effects brought about by startling flight postponements, and offset expanding flight interest with developing flight delays, an exact forecast of flight delays in air terminals is required.

As part of this project, I intend to use the dataset on “Airline delay analysis” from Source: Kaggle. The dataset contains daily airline activity covering flight information, carrier company, taxing-in, taxing-out time, and generalized delay reason of exactly 10 years, from 2009 to 2019. The data consists of columns describing flight delay, carrier details, departure time, destination, and origin locations.
