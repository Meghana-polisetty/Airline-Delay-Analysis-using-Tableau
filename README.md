# Airline-Delay-Analysis-using-Tableau
Analysis of U.S. flight delay data from 2016â€“2019.
Delays in flights are among the most common and unpleasant experiences people have. Many passengers in the United States experience delays each year, resulting in missed connections and lost time. Airlines and passengers alike incur cost penalties every day when flights are delayed. Both the airline's reputation and the safety of passengers are at stake. In 2018, U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) data shows that more than 20% of flights have been delayed. Statistically, flight delays in the U.S. have an excessive financial impact of 40.7 billion dollars annually. Within the scope of this research, I intend to utilize the dataset on "Airline delay analysis" from Kaggle. This dataset covers daily airline activity for 4 years spanning from 2016 to 2019, containing flight information, company name, time of taxing in and out, and generalized reasons for delays. It contains columns with information about flight delays, carriers, origin and departure locations, and arrival and departure times. By identifying the patterns in the data, the project will analyze the data and create a Tableau visualization storyboard that can be used to gain deeper insight into the airlines' delay patterns and performance.
